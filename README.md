## ```AI ScreenShot```
It is an chrome extension that takes custom screen shot and extract text out of it. Detailed explanation below.

# Problem Statement (Background)

 We often need to type out text from videos, images, or thumbnails on websites. This can be a tedious and error-prone process, especially if the text is long or has tricky stuff like website links, technical words, code examples, or math equations. This issue comes up on YouTube, where useful info is shown in videos or thumbnail images.

## Some of the scenarios where this problem arises:

### In the MrBeast Riddle video, he displays a YouTube link to visit as part of the riddle, but manually typing the link is inefficient and prone to errors.

### A math lecture video full of complex equations in Laplacian notation. Typing or searching would be a total pain.

### Copying of code to the editor directly is not possible.

## We propose to develop a Chrome extension {AI Screenshot}:



- ### Custom Area Screenshot: Select any area of a webpage/video to screenshot. This will allow to extract images from a particular part of the image. This will allow us to extract hyperlinks, code, complex equations, etc. 

- ### Webpage Summary: Summarize text from a screenshot capture of any webpage in the user-chosen language (MultiModal).
- ### YouTube Video Screenshot: Capture text in the current video frame on the YouTube website. (Not Implemented)

Working and Tech Stack


# Tech Stack
- HTML (frontend)
- Tailwind CSS (frontend)
- JavaScript (Backend)
- Tesseract (OCR recognition)
- Google Gemini API (LLM for summarization)










 #    Working

## Our Chrome extension is utilizing Tesseract OCR for character recognition in the image and Google Gemini API is used for summarization of text.
1. The extension's background script ```worker.js``` listens for user actions, such as clicking the extension's icon or using the context menu.
2. When the user initiates a screenshot, the extension captures the visible tab using ```chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab``` and gets the screenshot data as a PNG image.
3. The extension then injects several scripts (```helper.js```, ```response.js```, ```elements.js```, and ```custom-elements.min.js```) into the current tab's context. These scripts are responsible for rendering the OCR result and handling the OCR process.
4. The ocr-result custom element, defined in ```elements.js```, is used to perform the OCR operation. This custom element utilizes the ```tesseract.js``` library, which is a pure JavaScript port of the Tesseract OCR engine.
5. The ocr-result element is configured with user preferences such as language, accuracy, and other settings fetched from the Chrome extension's local storage.
6. The captured screenshot data (PNG image) is passed to the ocr-result element, which then runs the Tesseract OCR engine on the image to extract the text.
7. The extracted text is rendered within the ocr-result element, allowing the user to view and interact with the OCR results.

 
### Similarly, if the user chooses to summarize the webpage then it will be done with the help of Google Gemini.
All the summarized extracted text is sent back to the Chrome extension popup window for display and coping.


> About Google Gemini: Gemini is the latest and best Large Language Model developed by Google. It can perform any task related to natural language (text) and is also capable of code and image generation.
It also allows developers to use its API to develop AI apps as we proposed here.

> Tesseract OCR: It is an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) engine developed by Google. It is designed to extract text from images and documents without a text layer, outputting the document in various formats such as plain text, HTML, PDF, and more. Tesseract supports recognition of over 100 languages "out of the box" and is highly customizable
